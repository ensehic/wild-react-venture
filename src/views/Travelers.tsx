                As you traverse the star system, you&apos;ll likely run into other other members of Outer Wilds Ventures. These encounters are moments
                of calm amidst all the chaos of your exploration of the system, so do take the opportunity to relax a bit. Sit by the campires, roast some marshmallows
                and have conversations with your fellow Hearthians. They&apos;re always interested in your discoveries throughout the solar system, but they&apos;re also
                happy enough to share their own findings with you.
